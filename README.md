## Roadmap 
These are some skills in order for a web developer to have:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- React or Angular
- Typescript
- Backend (Flask or Django or node.js)
- Databases
- Hosting

After you have a firm grip on all these concepts you get to be called a full stack developer.

Offcource there are many other skills and platforms to learn to level up the game but these are just some basics.

## Note
Feel free to contribute if you like the repository and I am always available at sobanpythonista@gmail.com
